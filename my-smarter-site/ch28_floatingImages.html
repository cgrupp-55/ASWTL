    <h1>Wrapping text around an Image with Float Properties</h1>
    <img class="wrapLeft" src="images\Salzburg Castle.jpg" width="200" height="121" alt="Salzburg Castle">
      <p>Wrapping text around an image requires the addition of a css class to create the image wrapping instructions, plus adding the class into the img.src tags within the html families.</p>
      <p>In the css file, add an <b><i>img.className</i></b>, such as <b><i>img.wrapLeft</i></b> or <b><i>img.wrapRight</i></b></p>
    <img class="wrapRight" src="images\sunwapta-falls-jasper-alberta-L-2.jpg" width="200" height="121" alt="Sunwapta Falls">
      <p>The <b><i>img.wrapRight</i></b> class tells the html file that any text that follws this image with this class will wrap around the image on the left.</p>
      <p>The <b><i>img.wrapLeft</i></b> class tells the html file that any text that follws this image with this class will wrap around the image on the right.</p>
      <p>A <b><i>p.noWrap</i></b> class tells the html file not to wrap anything from this point forward in the page.</p>
      <p> Here is more text to make the point</p>
    <img class="wrapLeft" src="images\Sumidero_Canyon,_Chiapas_(2086608721).jpg" width="200" height="121" alt="Sumidero Canyon">
      <p>Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers, and often hold on to branches with three of their four limbs. To move between trees, they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap. They will also grip branches with only their hind feet, lift themselves upright, and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey. Due to their slow movement, all lorises, including the slow lorises, have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation.

        Their slow, deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent. Once disturbed, they immediately stop moving and remain motionless. In Indonesia, slow lorises are called malu malu or "shy one" because they freeze and cover their face when spotted. If cornered, they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at the predator.</p>        <p>Notice the <b><i>Display: Block</i></b> property removed the inline relationship between the above three images.<br>
        In addition, I added the <b><i>padding: 1em;</i></b> property to the css img class to create vertical spacing between iamge</p>
    <img class="wrapLeft" src="images\sunwapta-falls-jasper-alberta-L-2.jpg" width="200" height="121" alt="Sunwapta Falls" class="block"><br>
    <p>Here the image elements are converted from inline to block elements by including in the related css files <b><i>"display: block;"</i></b> classes with the format in the html file of <b><i>ClassName="Block"</i></b> command included in the <b><i>img src</i></b> tag.</p>
    <p>Here the image has a margin adjustment of top=25px right=50px bottom=25px left 75px.</p>
      <img class="centerImage" src="images\Sumidero_Canyon,_Chiapas_(2086608721).jpg" width="200" height="121" alt="Sumidero Canyon" class="setImageMargin">
