    <h1>This page demonstrates the use of link addresses</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>When a link (e.g., anchor tab with href property) does not reference a specific  file, such as a link to the web site of <b><i>https://www.w3schools.com/</i></b>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3school.com Home Page</a>, the browser will assume you want the <b><i>index.html</i>,</b> file at that site's location.</p>
       <p>When linking to another file, use the entire URL, such as <b><i>https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</i></b>, such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3school HTML Home Page</a>"</p>
       <p><b>Note:</b> The above url has a subfolder, <b><i>HTML</i></b>, listed in the URL, plus the desired filename is specified as part of the URL&apos;s path.</p>
       <p><b>Note:</b> There can be any number of subfolder levels specified in the path.</p>
       <p><b>Note:</b> When the href does not specify a URL&apos;s domain name, the browsers will assume the page is referncing a file on the user&apos;s computer. But, you still have to specify the directory structure to specify the files&apos;s location.</p>
       <p><b>Note:</b> If the location of the page is on a subdirectory that is one level down from the <b>Home</b> page, but on the same level as the location of the web page, the href property must use an instruction in the path to go up one directory, and then come back down to the target directory. The instruction with the path is <b><i>../newDirectory/fileName</i></b>.</p>
       <p><b>Note:</b> If the page is several levels down from the <b>Home</b> page, then you would use as many <b><i>../</i></b> instructions as necessary to get to the level of the <b>Home</b> page. For example, to go two levels up to get to the Home page, the href property would include these instructions: <b><i>../../newDirectory/fileName</i></b>.</p>

   <h1>Slow Lorises</h2>
      <!--adding blockquote tag. noe that you don't need to add / the closeing tag.-->
    <blockquote>
      <p>Little is known about the social structure of slow lorises, but they generally spend most of the night foraging alone. Individuals sleep during the day, usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises. Home ranges of adults may significantly overlap, and those of males are generally larger than those of females. In the absence of direct studies of the genus, primatologist Simon Bearder speculated that slow loris social behavior is similar to that of the potto, another nocturnal primate. Such a social system is distinguished by a lack of matriarchy and by factors that allow the slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure. Vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited; scent marking with urine is the dominant form of communication. Adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males. Vocalizations include an affiliative (friendly) call krik, and a louder call resembling a crow's caw. When disturbed, slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl. To make contact with other individuals, they emit a single high-pitched rising tone, and females use a high whistle when in estrus.</p>
      <p>Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers, and often hold on to branches with three of their four limbs.[96] To move between trees, they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap.[7] They will also grip branches with only their hind feet, lift themselves upright, and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey.[96] Due to their slow movement, all lorises, including the slow lorises, have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation. Their slow, deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent. Once disturbed, they immediately stop moving and remain motionless.[97] In Indonesia, slow lorises are called malu malu or "shy one" because they freeze and cover their face when spotted.[98] If cornered, they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at the predator.[97] The Acehnese name, buah angin ("wind monkey"), refers to their ability to "fleetingly but silently escape".[99] Little is known about the predation of slow lorises. Documented predators include snakes, the changeable hawk-eagle (Nisaetus cirrhatus),[100] and Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii).[101] Other potential predators include cats, sun bears (Helarctos malayanus), binturongs (Arctictis binturong), and civets.[102]</p><blockquote>
