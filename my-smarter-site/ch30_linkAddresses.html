    <h1>This page demonstrates the use of link addresses</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>When a link (e.g., anchor tab with href property) does not reference a specific  file, such as a link to the web site of <b><i>https://www.w3schools.com/</i></b>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3school.com Home Page</a>, the browser will assume you want the <b><i>index.html</i>,</b> file at that site's location.</p>
      <p>When linking to another file, use the entire URL, such as <b><i>https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</i></b>, such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3school HTML Home Page</a>"</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> The above url has a subfolder, <b><i>HTML</i></b>, listed in the URL, plus the desired filename is specified as part of the URL&apos;s path.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> There can be any number of subfolder levels specified in the path.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> When the href does not specify a URL&apos;s domain name, the browsers will assume the page is referncing a file on the user&apos;s computer. But, you still have to specify the directory structure to specify the files&apos;s location.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> If the location of the page is on a subdirectory that is one level down from the <b>Home</b> page, but on the same level as the location of the web page, the href property must use an instruction in the path to go up one directory, and then come back down to the target directory. The instruction with the path is <b><i>../newDirectory/fileName</i></b>.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> If the page is several levels down from the <b>Home</b> page, then you would use as many <b><i>../</i></b> instructions as necessary to get to the level of the <b>Home</b> page. For example, to go two levels up to get to the Home page, the href property would include these instructions: <b><i>../../newDirectory/fileName</i></b>.</p>
