  <h1>Inheritance in html and css</h1>
    <Blockquote>
      <p>This page demonstrates the concepts of <b>Inheritance</b> in html and css</p>
      <p>In HTML, the page is organized into <b>parents</b> and <b>children</b></p>
      <p>The <b>parent</b> of all content displayed in the page is the <b>Body</b> section of the HTML file. Everything else is a <b>Child</b> of the <b>Parent</b> <i>body</i>.</p>
      <p>Conceptually, all content displayed in the <b>Body</b> can inherit the properties assigned to the <b>Body</B>.
      <p>In the CSS file, simple assign html elements and css classes to the <b>Body</b> <i>element</i></p>
      <p>Little is known about the social structure of slow lorises, but they generally spend most of the night foraging alone. Individuals sleep during the day, usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises. Home ranges of adults may significantly overlap, and those of males are generally larger than those of females. In the absence of direct studies of the genus, primatologist Simon Bearder speculated that slow loris social behavior is similar to that of the potto, another nocturnal primate. Such a social system is distinguished by a lack of matriarchy and by factors that allow the slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure. Vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited; scent marking with urine is the dominant form of communication. Adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males. Vocalizations include an affiliative (friendly) call krik, and a louder call resembling a crow's caw. When disturbed, slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl. To make contact with other individuals, they emit a single high-pitched rising tone, and females use a high whistle when in estrus.</p>
      <p>Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers, and often hold on to branches with three of their four limbs.[96] To move between trees, they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap.[7] They will also grip branches with only their hind feet, lift themselves upright, and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey.[96] Due to their slow movement, all lorises, including the slow lorises, have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation. Their slow, deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent. Once disturbed, they immediately stop moving and remain motionless.[97] In Indonesia, slow lorises are called malu malu or "shy one" because they freeze and cover their face when spotted.[98] If cornered, they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at the predator.[97] The Acehnese name, buah angin ("wind monkey"), refers to their ability to "fleetingly but silently escape".[99] Little is known about the predation of slow lorises. Documented predators include snakes, the changeable hawk-eagle (Nisaetus cirrhatus),[100] and Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii).[101] Other potential predators include cats, sun bears (Helarctos malayanus), binturongs (Arctictis binturong), and civets.[102]</p>
