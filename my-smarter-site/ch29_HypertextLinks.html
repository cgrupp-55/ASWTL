        <img class="wrapLeft" src="images\Salzburg Castle.jpg" width="500" height="302" alt="Salzburg Castle">
          <p>Shown in the picture on the left is <a href="https://www.exploring-castles.com/europe/austria/hohensalzburg_castle/">Salzburg Castle</a> in Austria. It&#39;s a vast, mighty fortress, seated upon the Festungsberg mount &#8208; a rocky crag which rises hundreds of metres above the city. The fortress is a dramatic contrast to the delicate streets of Salzburg&apos;s Altstadt, which weave gently below it.</p>
          <p>Hohensalzburg was founded back in 1077, and gradually evolved into one of Europe&#39;s largest fortresses. It&#39;s an impressive site &#8208; it measures around a quarter of a kilometre in length, and is surrounded by vast curtain walls.</p>
          <p>Perhaps as a result, the fortress was never seriously threatened by military force.</p>
          <p>Inside the castle today, you&#39;ll discover quite a variety of things to see &#8208; including a Museum of the City, a Museum of Puppetry, and an understated little Romanesque chapel belonging to St George.</p>
          <p>Most visitors come for the spectacular views across Salzburg, which reach out to the Austrian Alps beyond.</p>
        <img class="wrapRight" src="images\sunwapta-falls-jasper-alberta-L-2.jpg" width="500" height="302" alt="Sunwapta Falls">
          <p><b><i>Sunwapta Falls</i></b> is located in Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada.</p>
          <p>Broad U-shaped hanging valleys were formed when glacier ice receded 8000 years ago. Larger valleys were carved deeper than smaller ones and in places where the two meet, the smaller valleys "hang" at a higher elevation. This is an excellent place to find waterfalls. At <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/jasper/activ/itineraires-itineraries/sunwapta">Sunwapta Falls</a>, the smaller "hanging" Chaba Valley and larger Athabasca Valley join in a spectacular stepping waterfall that has carved a deep limestone gorge out of the rock some metres below the footbridge.</p>
          <p>Sunwapta Falls is also the trailhead for a beautiful backcountry trail that features campgrounds along the Athabasca River and majestic peaks towering in the background. The trail passes through the Chaba River burn area, legacy of a 1967 wildfire. The fire rejuvenated a large portion of the subalpine forest along the Chaba River Valley and is now one of the best bear and moose habitats in the park.</p>
        <img class="wrapLeft" src="images\Sumidero_Canyon,_Chiapas_(2086608721).jpg" width="500" height="302" alt="Sumidero Canyon">
          <p>Sumidero Canyon (Spanish: Canon del Sumidero) is a deep natural canyon located just north of the city of Chiapa de Corzo in the state of Chiapas, in southern Mexico. The canyon's creation began around the same time as the Grand Canyon in the U.S. state of Arizona, by a crack in the area's crust and subsequent erosion by the Grijalva River, which still runs through it. Sumidero Canyon has vertical walls which reach as high as 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), with the river turning up to 90 degrees during the 13&#8208;kilometre (8.1 mi) length of the narrow passage.</p>
          <p>The canyon is surrounded by the Sumidero Canyon National Park, a federally protected natural area of Mexico which extends for 21,789 hectares (53,840 acres) over four municipalities of the state of Chiapas. This park is administered by the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP). Most of the vegetation in the park is low- to medium&#8208;height deciduous rainforest, with small areas of mixed pine&#8208;oak forest and grassland. At the north end of the canyon is the Chicoasén Dam and its artificial reservoir, one of several on the Grijalva River, which is important for water storage and the generation of hydroelectric power in the region. </p>
