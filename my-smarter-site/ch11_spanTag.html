    <h1>Using the Span Tag.</h1>
    <p>This html file shows how to use the span tag to format sections of text in a header of paragragh.</p>
    <p>For this excercise, I've created a class titled <b><i>emphasized</i></b> that is <i>italics</i> and <b>bold</b> in style.</p>
    <h4>"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum, <span class="emphasized">quia dolor sit amet,</span> consectetur, adipisci velit..."</h4>
    <h4>"There is no one who loves pain itself, <span class="emphasized">who seeks after it and wants to have it,</span> simply because it is pain..."</h4>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <span class="emphasized">Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</span> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </span class="emphasized">It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum  passages,</span> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
    <p><span class="emphasized">Test Text</span></p>
